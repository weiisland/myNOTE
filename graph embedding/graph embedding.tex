	\section{Graph analytic tasks:}
	
	\subsection{node classification:}
	
	aims at determining the {\color{red}label of nodes} based on other labeled nodes and the topology(拓扑) of the network.
	
	\textbf{methods: }random walks to propagate the labels; extracts feature from nodes and apply classifier on them.
	
	\subsection{link prediction:}
	
	refers to the task of predicting missing links or links that are likely to occur in the future.
	
	\textbf{methods: }similarity based methods, maximum liklihood models, probability models.
	
	\subsection{clustering}
	
	find subsets of similar nodes and group them together.
	
	\textbf{methods: }attribute based models and methods which direclty maximize the inter-cluster distances.
	
	\subsection{visualization}
	
	helps in providing insights into the structure of the network.
